#function name: around
#description: Preserve the function properties and prevent an error from terminating the program
#arguments: One or more functions
#return value: none
#noteï¼š Decorators are implemented in such a way that the function being decorated is actually another function (the function name and other properties change).
#To avoid this, Python's FuncTools package provides a decorator called wraps to remove such side effects.
#When writing a decorator, it is a good idea to wrap FuncTools before implementing it.
#It preserves the name and properties of the original function
